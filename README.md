# work-day-schedular

### This is a simple jQuery work day schedular application for module challenge 5. I worked on this application with the help of the given starter code.This application is intended to be used on the everyday work day and this allows user to save events for every hour of the day.In this application moment.js is used which shows the current day when user opens the work day schedular application. In this application With the help of Bootstraps it's possible to built the work day schedular structure which shows the time, text area for description and save button to save the events. While working on this aplication I thought it is not going to be that challenging. It's a most challenging application and full of fun I worked so far as I tried to write my codes in jQuerry instead of JavaScript. I took full adavantage of my tutor session, also going through the saved recordings of our instructor from the NorthWestern classes, took help from  [Mozilla]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript "dev.Mozilla"), [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/ "w3Schools"), asked questions in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com "stackoverflow.com") for this module challenge. Still I have to learn a lot but taking help from the above sites really helped me a lot in understanding the code. Writing code with the guidance of tutor and above sites made me understand a lot. I am little confused whether to use _$( document ).ready(function()_ or not as my tutor told me that now-a-days it is not necessary but in all online sites it asked to do. This is my learning stage that's why I am skipping this step for now and will wait for the comment if I have to use it or not.
